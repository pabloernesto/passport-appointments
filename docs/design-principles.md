1. As a goverment website, imposing unnecessary difficulty is wrong
  - Make the whole process quick and painless
  - Don't discriminate against older people
1. As a goverment website, accessibility is paramount
  - Mobile first
  - Compatibility with older browsers
  - Compatibility with lots of browser vendors
  - Screen reader accessible
  - Keyboard accessible
  - Accessible with JavaScript disabled
1. We don't want to pay for hosting (because we're broke)
  - Keep it light on the backend
  - Not using frameworks (e.g. Express)
